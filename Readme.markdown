![Stone Mill Screenshot](http://mcspider.bzextreme.com/files/Stone%20Mill%200.0.png)
  
Classic Nine men's morris with a optional twist, once tiles can jump they leave behind a ghost stone that disappears after the next turn.
  
#### Goals
  
- Create a semi-smart AI to play against.
- Enter this in the uDevGames 2011 Games Competition. (When I can honestly say that this will be finished).
